-----------------------------------

1. Introduction for Beginners

Start with:  
- JSX — HTML-like tags inside JavaScript.  
- React components as the core interactive units.

Basic Example:
``` (jsx) ```
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
`````````````````````````````````````````````

-----------------------------------------

2. Adding React to an Existing Website

-> Purpose 🛠️
To add React to a part of your existing website without rebuilding the whole thing.

-> Steps:
2.1. Prepare your development environment
- Install Node.js and a module-based tool (like Vite or Babel).
- Install React:
`````````````````````````````
npm install react react-dom

``````````````````````````````

 2.2. Test the setup

``` (js) ```
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

document.body.innerHTML = '<div id="app"></div>';
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('app'));
root.render(<h1>Hello, world</h1>);
```

#### 2.3. Use React in specific parts of the page
In your HTML:
```html
<nav id="navigation"></nav>
```
In your JS:
```js
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function NavigationBar() {
  return <h1>React here!</h1>;
}

const domNode = document.getElementById('navigation');
createRoot(domNode).render(<NavigationBar />);
```

## 3. Gradually Introduce React

- Start with small components (buttons, navbar…)  
- Add more interactivity over time  
- As usage grows, consider switching to a full framework like **Next.js** or **React Router**

---

## 4. React Native Integration (Optional)

If you have an existing native Android or iOS app, you can gradually add a React Native screen as well – following the official React Native guide.

---

## 5. Key Recommendations for Beginners

- Use **JSX** to write components.
- Set up a project using **Vite** or **Babel** to enable modern tooling.
- Use **createRoot** to attach React to existing DOM elements.
- Start small, then expand gradually.
- When needed, adopt a full framework like:
  - Next.js
  - React Router
  - Expo (for native apps)
