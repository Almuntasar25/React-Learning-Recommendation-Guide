## ᾟ1 1. Overview

To build a new React app, it's recommended to use a full-stack framework that provides features like routing, static generation, and gradual server rendering.

---

## 🏗️ 2. Recommended Full-Stack Frameworks

### • Next.js (App Router)

* A React framework developed by Vercel.
* Supports SPA, SSR, SSG, and more.
* Uses React's latest features like Server Components and Suspense.
* Create a project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### • React Router (v7)

* A popular routing library.
* With Vite, it forms a modern full-stack setup.
* Create a project:

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest
```

### • Expo (for Native Apps)

* Build cross-platform apps for iOS, Android, and web.
* Create a project:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

## 🧹 3. Other Emerging Frameworks

### • TanStack Start (Beta)

* Built with TanStack Router.
* Supports SSR, streaming, server functions with Vite + Nitro.

### • RedwoodJS

* Full-stack framework with preconfigured packages.

---

## ⚙️ 4. Build from Scratch

If you have special requirements, you can:

* Choose your own bundler: Vite, Parcel, RSbuild, etc.
* Manually configure state, routing, etc.
* Follow the official guide: "Build a React App from Scratch".

---

## 🔍 5. React’s Framework Vision

React is investing in new primitives like:

### • Server Components

* Async React components rendered on the server.
* Sends final HTML and props to the browser.

### • Suspense

* For loading placeholders (e.g., skeletons) within React trees.

**Note:** These are best supported today by Next.js with the App Router.

---

## 👍 Conclusion

* Use a full-stack framework like Next.js or Expo for rapid development.
* Build from scratch only if you need deep customization.
* Learn about React's latest architecture: Server Components + Suspense.
